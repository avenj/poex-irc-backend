# Changes for POEx::IRC::Backend

0.027002 2015-06-07

  - Default to using a 'colonify => 0' filter_irc; this seems to line 
    up better with expected behavior and matches POE::Filter::IRCv3's
    default

  - Fix ->send to respect the 'colonify' attribute of a given
    IRC::Message::Object

  - Depend on newer IRC::Toolkit so we can access $ircmsg->has_colonify
