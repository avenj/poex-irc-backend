# Changes for POEx::IRC::Backend

0.027006 2015-06-25

  - Fix server-side SSLification (miniCruzer)

  - Documentation improvements

0.027005 2015-06-19

  - Warn informatively on ->disconnect against an inactive wheel
    and fix documentation regarding how to avoid that particular race

0.027004 2015-06-19

  - Fix a ->disconnect bug that could throw an exception under race
    (reported by Sam "miniCruzer" Hoffman)

0.027003 2015-06-13

  - Optimize ->send when used with IRC::Message::Object messages

  - Switch to Moo-2, strictures-2; drop MooX::late

0.027002 2015-06-07

  - Default to using a 'colonify => 0' filter_irc; this seems to line

    default

  - Fix ->send to respect the 'colonify' attribute of a given
    IRC::Message::Object
    (reported by Sam "miniCruzer" Hoffman)

  - Depend on newer IRC::Toolkit so we can access $ircmsg->has_colonify
