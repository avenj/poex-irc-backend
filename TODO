(loosely priority-ordered)

# Test improvements.
  - disconnect behavior (check git stash)
  - peer-to-peer zlib

# Refactor to hide ->wheel
  (low-priority and probably breaks irssi-bouncer)
  - Role::HasWheel; wheel -> _wheel
    wheel_id grabs/caches from _wheel
    has_wheel & clear_wheel remain as-is
