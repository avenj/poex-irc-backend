# Test improvements.
  - disconnect behavior ('disconnect' branch)
  - SSL (if SSLify present)
  - peer-to-peer zlib

# Optional idle timer for outgoing Connector-spawned Connects.
  - currently an idle timer only runs for Connects spawned by Listeners
    (which fits the standard server PING -> client PONG dialog) but not those
    set up by an outgoing connector, which may be useful for some users; at the very
    least it should be clearly documented how to emulate this on the controller side

# Optionally skip ircmsg() and dispatch raw events from _ircsock_input
  - attr 'dispatch' isa Enum[qw/raw ircmsg/] & default to 'ircmsg' ?

# IP blacklisting for Listeners
  - per-backend and/or per-listener

# Rethink roles a bit;
  - Currently Connectors and Listeners consume Role::Socket but Connects do not.
    Connects do have their own ->protocol and ->args matching Role::Socket,
    and could make use of ->ssl
    -(DONE) move addr/port out of Role::Socket to Role::HasEndpoint
    -(DONE) consume Role::HasEndpoint from Connector.pm / Listener.pm
    -(DONE) consume Role::Socket from Connect.pm
    - audit tests

# Expose more SSLify functions
  - $conn->ssl_object -> GetSSL (or undef if ssl == 0)
  - $conn->ssl_cipher -> GetCipher (or '' if ssl == 0)
  - $conn->get_socket -> GetSocket if ssl == 1 (else ->wheel->get_input_handle)
