# Test improvements.
  - t/backend/connect.t is incomplete
  - t/backend/role is deprecated, should be inlined to class-specific
    tests and removed
  - disconnect behavior ('disconnect' branch)
  - peer-to-peer zlib

# Optional idle timer for outgoing Connector-spawned Connects.
  - currently an idle timer only runs for Connects spawned by Listeners
    (which fits the standard server PING -> client PONG dialog) but not those
    set up by an outgoing connector, which may be useful for some users; at the very
    least it should be clearly documented how to emulate this on the controller side

# Optionally skip ircmsg() and dispatch raw events from _ircsock_input
  - attr 'dispatch' isa Enum[qw/raw ircmsg/] & default to 'ircmsg' ?

# IP blacklisting for Listeners
  - per-backend and/or per-listener
