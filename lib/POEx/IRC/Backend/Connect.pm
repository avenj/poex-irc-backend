=head1 NAME

POEx::IRC::Backend::Connect - A connected IRC socket

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Typically created by L<POEx::IRC::Backend> to represent an established
connection.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These objects contain details regarding connected socket 
L<POE::Wheel::ReadWrite> wheels managed by 
L<POEx::IRC::Backend>.

=head2 CONSUMES

This class consumes the following roles:

L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Role::HasWheel>

L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Role::Socket>

=head2 ATTRIBUTES

=head3 alarm_id

Connected socket wheels normally have a POE alarm ID attached for an idle 
timer.

Predicate: C<has_alarm_id>

B<rw> attribute.

=head3 compressed

Boolean true if the Zlib filter has been added.

See also: L<POEx::IRC::Backend/set_compressed_link>

=head3 set_compressed

Change the boolean value of the L</compressed> attrib.

=head3 idle

Idle time used for connection check alarms.

See also: L</ping_pending>, L<POEx::IRC::Backend/ircsock_connection_idle>

=head3 is_disconnecting

Boolean false if the Connect is not in a disconnecting state; if it is 
true, it is the disconnect message:

  $obj->is_disconnecting("Client quit")

B<rw> attribute.

See also: L<POEx::IRC::Backend/disconnect>

=head3 is_client

Boolean true if the connection wheel has been marked as a client.

B<rw> attribute.

=head3 is_peer

Boolean true if the connection wheel has been marked as a peer.

B<rw> attribute.

=head3 is_pending_compress

Primarily for internal use; boolean true if the Wheel needs a Zlib filter on
next buffer flush.

B<rw> attribute.

=head3 ping_pending

The C<ping_pending> attribute can be used to manage standard IRC
PING/PONG heartbeating; a server can call C<< $conn->ping_pending(1) >> upon
dispatching a PING to a client (because of an C<ircsock_connection_idle>
event, for example) and C<< $conn->ping_pending(0) >> when a
response is received.

If C<< $conn->ping_pending >> is true on the next C<ircsock_connection_idle>,
the client can be considered to have timed out and your server-side C<Backend>
can issue a disconnect; this emulates standard IRCD behavior.

B<rw> attribute.

See also: L<POEx::IRC::Backend/ircsock_connection_idle>

=head3 peeraddr

The remote peer address.

Writer: C<set_peeraddr>

=head3 peerport

The remote peer port.

Writer: C<set_peerport>

=head3 seen

Timestamp of last socket activity; updated by L<POEx::IRC::Backend> when
traffic is seen from this Connect.

B<rw> attribute.

=head3 sockaddr

Our socket address.

Writer: C<set_sockaddr>

=head3 sockport

Our socket port.

Writer: C<set_sockport>

=head2 METHODS

=head3 get_socket

Returns the actual underlying socket handle, or undef if one is not open.

If this is a SSLified socket, the real handle is retrieved via
L<POE::Component::SSLify/SSLify_GetSocket>.

=head3 ssl_cipher

Returns the cipher in use by calling
L<POE::Component::SSLify/SSLify_GetCipher>, or the empty string if this is not
an SSLified connection.

=head3 ssl_object

Returns the underlying L<Net::SSLeay> object via
L<POE::Component::SSLify/SSLify_GetSSL>, or undef if this is not an SSLified
connection.
