POEx::IRC::Backend::Role::HasWheel

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 wheel

A L<POE::Wheel> instance; typically L<POE::Wheel::SocketFactory> for
L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Listener> and L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Connector> objects,
or L<POE::Wheel::ReadWrite> for live L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Connect> objects.

This is primarily for internal use. B<< External code should not interact
directly with the C<wheel>; >> doing so may result in misdelivered events and
other unexpected behavior.

Clearer: B<clear_wheel>

Predicate: B<has_wheel>

Writer: B<set_wheel>

=head2 wheel_id

The POE ID of the last known L</wheel>.
