=head1 NAME

POEx::IRC::Backend::Role::Socket - IRC socket connector behavior

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A role defining some basic attributes shared by L<POEx::IRC::Backend> sockets.

This role is consumed by L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Connect>,
L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Connector>, and 
L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Listener> objects.

This role consumes L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Role::HasWheel> and adds the
following attributes:

=head2 args

Arbitrary metadata attached to this Connector. (By default, this is a HASH.)

This is typically passed on to a successfully spawned
L<POEx::IRC::Backend::Connect>.

Predicate: B<has_args>

=head2 protocol

The Internet protocol version for this listener (4 or 6).

=head2 ssl

Boolean value indicating whether connections should be SSLified.
